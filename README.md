<p><h1>Multiprogramming Operating system</h1> <br>
Sharing the processor, when two or more programs reside in memory at the same time, is referred as multiprogramming. <br>
Multiprogramming assumes a single shared processor. Multiprogramming increases CPU utilization by organizing jobs <br>
so that the CPU always has one to execute.</p>

<p>An OS does the following activities related to multiprogramming.<br>
The operating system keeps several jobs in memory at a time.<br>
This set of jobs is a subset of the jobs kept in the job pool.<br>
The operating system picks and begins to execute one of the jobs in the memory.<br>
Multiprogramming operating systems monitor the state of all active programs and <br>
system resources using memory management programs to ensures that the CPU is never idle, <br>
unless there are no jobs to process.</p>

<p><h3>Advantages</h3><br>
High and efficient CPU utilization.<br>
User feels that many programs are allotted CPU almost simultaneously.</p>

<p><h3>Disadvantages</h3><br>
CPU scheduling is required.<br>
To accommodate many jobs in memory, memory management is required.<br>
